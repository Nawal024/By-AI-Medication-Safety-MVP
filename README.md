# SafeMeds — AI-Powered Medication Safety for Pilgrims

## Project Overview
**SafeMeds** is an innovative mobile application designed to enhance the safety of medications carried by pilgrims during Hajj and Umrah. Using **artificial intelligence (AI)** and image recognition, the app analyzes medications captured through a smartphone camera and provides instant feedback on their authenticity, expiration, potential drug interactions, and storage conditions.

The app aims to reduce the risks of counterfeit or expired medications, ensure proper storage, and promote overall health safety for pilgrims, especially elderly users and those with chronic conditions.

- **Expiration Date Alerts**: Notifies users if a medication is near or past its expiration.
- **Drug Interaction Check**: Compares the medication with others in the user’s list to identify potential adverse interactions.
- **Proper Storage Guidance**: Alerts for medications that require specific temperature or sunlight conditions.
- **Personal Medication List**: Allows users to manage their medications and receive ongoing notifications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for easy use by pilgrims of all ages.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages for accessibility to international users.

3. **Verification & Alerts**:
   - Checks medication authenticity.
   - Verifies expiration date.
   - Checks for potential drug interactions.
   - Assesses storage requirements.
4. **Results & Recommendations**: Displays results in an easy-to-read format, with color-coded alerts and safe alternatives if needed.
5. **Medication Management**: Users can add medications to their personal list and receive notifications for updates or risks.
